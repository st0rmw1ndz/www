Who am I? I'll get back to you when I'm able to fully answer. For the moment I can tell you this: the name's frosty and my main interests are software development and most things Linux related. I also used to do some photography, though I've slowed down on that. I do plan on getting into it again.

Most of my personal machines use some form of a minimal window manager, such as [xmonad](https://xmonad.org/), [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/), or [Openbox](https://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page). These are my favorite environments to be in and I often hop between them, mostly between my workstation and laptop. If you'd like to see my configurations, check out my [dotfiles](https://codeberg.org/frosty/dotfiles).

I've been getting into server management as well, though at a very surface level. Most of my servers just run some Docker containers and services. They're all for personal use and convenience, with services such as [Immich](https://immich.app/) and [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/).

Other than that, I have a few other machines that I use for development and just playing around. Currently, my primary distributions are [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/) and [Artix](https://artixlinux.org/) Linux. In addition to that, I also use [Void](https://voidlinux.org/) and [Devuan](https://www.devuan.org/), though for nothing serious. Check out my [machines](/machines) page for info on some of my machines I use! I plan to add more over time.

I like [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox), btw.
