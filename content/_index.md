# Welcome

Hello, and welcome! This is my little playground for messing around with ideas on the web. It's fairly lackluster at the moment, but I plan to expand it as time passes with more interesting things.

For the moment, you're able to check out the [about](/about) page which has a little more information about me, as well as the [machines](/machines) page for info on some of the machines I use (all run Linux!).
