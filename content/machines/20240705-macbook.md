My primary laptop to take with me is my trusty 13-inch MacBook Air (Mid-2013). Check out the specifications [here](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook-air/specs/macbook-air-core-i5-1.3-13-mid-2013-specs.html). Here's the important ones:

* CPU: Intel Core i5-4250U @ 1.3 GHz
* Memory: 4 GiB DDR3 @ 1600 MHz
* Disk: 128 GiB (proprietary) SSD
* Display: 1440x900 13.3"
* OS: [Gentoo Linux](https://www.gentoo.org/)

## What's it like?

Before you even mention it, yes, it's running Gentoo. Why am I doing this to myself? Well, this laptop is mainly a test bench for new operating systems I want to try. Currently, Gentoo is my primary non-primary OS. By that I mean, it's the current OS that I haven't installed on my workstation that I'm trying to use as a daily driver. Ignoring that, there's one issue. The Wi-Fi drivers are proprietary Broadcom garbage. Thankfully, both Gentoo and Arch have drivers available to install via their package managers, so there's no issues getting the system running.

How is Gentoo, then? Fantastic! The compile times for components such as my kernel or QtWebEngine (thanks, [qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/)) are absolutely horrific. But, if you set your expectations right, it's really great to use. It's running both [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) and [Openbox](http://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page) as I often hop between them. I don't do much on it other than listen to music or keep up with this website. Though, I don't do much outside of those things in the first place.
