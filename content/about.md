Who am I? I'm still not 100% sure, but I usually go by frosty (lowercase). My main interests are software development and anything Linux related.

Most of my machines use some form of a minimal window manager, such as [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) or [Openbox](http://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page). These two are my bread and butter, and are my favorites to use. I recommend [Openbox](http://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page) with the [tint2](https://gitlab.com/o9000/tint2) panel to new window manager users coming from a desktop environment.

I have a few computers at home that I use for servers, development, and playing around. Most of my machines run a variant of either Arch Linux or Debian. I used to use Windows for most things, but I've stopped using it since then.

I like [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox), btw.
