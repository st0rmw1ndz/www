# Welcome

Hello, and welcome! This is my little playground for messing around with ideas on the web. It's fairly lackluster at the moment, but I plan to expand it as time passes with more interesting things.

For the moment, you're able to check out the [about](/about) page which has a little more information about me, as well as the [machines](/machines) page for info on some of the machines I use (all run Linux!).

If you'd like to see my works elsewhere, check out my [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/frosty), as well as my [git.gay](https://git.gay/f) and [GitHub](https://github.com/st0rmw1ndz). I mirror most things to both. Though, keep in mind that GitHub is a last resort. If you'd like to contribute, please use Codeberg!
