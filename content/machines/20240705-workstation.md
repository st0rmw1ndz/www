My primary workstation is a MSI GF63 Thin 10SC-838. What a mouthful, anyways, you can see the full specifications [here](https://storage-asset.msi.com/excelSku/us/nb/GF63%20Thin%2010SC-838.pdf), but here's the gist:

* CPU: Intel i5-10500H (6 cores) @ 4.50 GHz
* Memory: 16 GiB (2x8G) @ 2666 MHz (upgraded from 8 GiB)
* GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Max-Q (4 GiB DDR5 VRAM)
* Disks: 256 GiB NVMe SSD (`/`), 512 GiB SATA SSD (`/home`)
* Display: 1920x1080 15.6"
* OS: [Artix Linux](https://artixlinux.org/)

## What's it like?

Nothing notable, it's all-round good, minus the fact it's using an NVIDIA card of course. NVIDIA and Linux go together just so well don't they? Joking aside, the real pain has been the fact it's using hybrid ([PRIME](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PRIME)) graphics. I'm sure if I had a desktop with an NVIDIA card it'd be smooth sailing. Other than that, it's had no issues. No drivers (othe than graphics) require proprietary blobs or anything like that. Thanks Intel!

It's running the [xmonad](https://xmonad.org/) window manager, and I'm just in love with it! I'm extremely new to xmonad and Haskell in general, but it's not as scary as I thought! I'm always tweaking my configurations to both xmonad and [xmobar](https://codeberg.org/xmobar/xmobar), and it's been a blast setting my environment up just as I want. I get even more enjoyment out of xmonad than I do [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) or [Openbox](http://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page) (though I still love them both dearly).
